Traffic Light Simulator Assignment (Assignment 2)

Objective:
Analyze and explain the TrafficLightSimulator program, focusing on the control structures used and their role in solving a real-world problem.

Questions:

1. Program Overview:
    a) Describe the overall purpose of this program.
    b) Explain how this program simulates a 24-hour period. What control structure is used for this, and why is it appropriate?

2. Time and Traffic Condition Handling:
    a) How does the program convert the simulation time to hours and minutes? Explain the mathematical operations used.
    b) Describe the control structure used in the determineTrafficCondition method. Why is this structure suitable for this task?

3. Light Duration Setting:
    a) Explain the control structure used in the setGreenLightDuration method. What are the advantages of using this structure?
    b) Compare and contrast the control structures used in setGreenLightDuration and setRedLightDuration. Why might different structures have been chosen for these similar tasks?

4. Main Simulation Loop:
    a) Identify and explain all the control structures used within the main method.
    b) How does the program create a delay between each "minute" of the simulation? Why is exception handling used here?

5. Code Organization:
    a) How does the use of methods (like determineTrafficCondition, setGreenLightDuration, etc.) contribute to the organization and readability of the code?
    b) Suggest one way the code could be further organized or improved using object-oriented programming concepts.

6. Real-world Application:
    a) How does this program reflect real-world traffic light operations? Provide examples of how it simulates actual traffic management.
    b) What limitations does this simulation have compared to a real traffic light system? Suggest one additional feature that could make it more realistic.

7. Control Structures Overview:
    a) List all the control structures used in this program and briefly explain the purpose of each in the context of the traffic light simulation.
    b) For each control structure you listed, explain why it was chosen over other potential options.

8. Code Modification:
    Propose and explain in detail how you would implement one of the following changes to the program, focusing on which control structures you would use and why:
    - Allow user input to manually change traffic conditions.
    - Implement a system to handle emergency vehicle priority.
    - Add a pedestrian crossing feature that interrupts the normal light cycle.

Submission Instructions:
- Provide detailed explanations for each question.
- Include code snippets where relevant to support your explanations.
- Your answers should demonstrate a clear understanding of Java control structures and their application in solving real-world problems.
